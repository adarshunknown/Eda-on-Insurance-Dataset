# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Insurance Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an Insurance dataset to identify key factors affecting medical insurance charges. The analysis provides insights into how demographic and lifestyle variables influence insurance costs.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes the following features:  
- **Age** – Age of the policyholder  
- **Sex** – Gender of the policyholder  
- **BMI** – Body Mass Index  
- **Children** – Number of dependents covered by insurance  
- **Smoker** – Smoking status (Yes/No)  
- **Region** – Residential region  
- **Charges** – Individual medical insurance charges  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore data distributions and detect outliers.  
- Analyze relationships between independent variables and charges.  
- Identify which features have the most impact on insurance costs.  
- Provide visual insights for better understanding of the dataset.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Wrangling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Smokers** pay significantly higher insurance charges.  
- Higher **BMI** is strongly correlated with increased costs.  
- **Age** shows a positive correlation with charges.  
- **Gender and region** have minimal effect on charges compared to smoking and BMI.
